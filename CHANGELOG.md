# Changelog

All notable changes to **Rich Markdown Diff** will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Mermaid Theming**: Render Mermaid diagrams with VS Code theme-aware colors and CSP-safe SVG style handling.
- **Scroll Sync**: Reduced mirrored-pane jitter by restoring active-pane ownership during synchronized scrolling.
- **Wide Tables**: Wrap tables in a dedicated horizontal scroll container so they do not stretch the diff panes.
- **Block Diffs**: Keep fully inserted KaTeX and code blocks wrapped as stable block-level diffs.

### Changed

- **Overview Ruler**: Align overview markers to each pane's live scrollbar track and size them from grouped change spans.
- **Default Chrome**: Disable gutter markers by default and remove the old hover-only blame/quick-edit chrome.
- **Change Highlighting**: Use insertion/deletion-aware active-change colors for code, Mermaid, and math blocks.
